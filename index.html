<h2>My Bio</h2>

<p>My name is Reenahshee. I was born 5th July 2002. I’m 21 years old. 
I was born in Malaysia, and I’m a Malaysian. I have 2 siblings. 
I’m currently studying in Taylor’s University Malaysia and majoring in design and specialized in UI/UX.</p>

<p>Describing myself, I would say I’m quiet person with a simple background.
Other than being quiet, I’m an understanding person, I don’t feel anything if anyone said something.
 Some people call me an observation person because I tend to be observative towards certain things.
  My favorite thing to do is playing games like Pac-Man, Mobile Legends and Zepeto.</p>

<p>I personally miss my home state, Sarawak. I was born in Klang, Selangor. 
I spend 12 years of living in Sarawak than living in Klang which just 7 years until primary standard 1.
 The thing I found here and there is very different especially the atmosphere but nevertheless I 
 prefer east Malaysia over west Malaysia.</p>

 <p>I only have 1 goal now and is getting a degree and graduating. 
My inspiration is myself; I know it’s weird but inspiring yourself is a great way to be
motivated but my role model is my father.</p>
